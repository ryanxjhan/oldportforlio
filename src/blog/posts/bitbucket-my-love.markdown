<p>I am currently taking CS246: Object Oriented Software Design at the University of Waterloo. I will post about my<strong> awesome rogue-like game final project</strong> which lead me to this discovery later; right now I want to <strong>praise <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org" target="_blank">BitBucket</a>. It is the best source code hosting website for students. </strong>Read on to find out why.</p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s time for a short story. My partner David and I had decided right away to use the popular <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> version control system to keep track of our project. The problem we faced right away was that the source code hosting website I had been using for my personal project previously, <strong>Github, does not (in my knowledge) offer any free and private source code hosting</strong>. In the case of our school project, considering plagiarism and future offerings of CS246 which might have this same project, we needed to use a private repository.</p>
<p>This leads to my discovery of BitBucket; I remember doing a quick Google search or something for other online Git source code hosting services. I navigated to the BitBucket website. Each plan is based, from what I can tell on their pricing page, entirely on the number of collaborators which are given. I found that they offered a half-decent free plan which allowed for 5 collaborators. I was satisfied with this, because the project I wanted to host would only have David and myself working on it, so it would be sufficient.</p>
<p>I signed up with my uwaterloo email address. <strong>This is important.</strong> Do you know why it is important? Because <strong>BitBucket offers it&#8217;s best plan, with unlimited collaborators and is regularly $100/month, free to those who sign up with an email address from an academic institution which has been registered with BitBucket.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever felt such a nice surprise from an internet service before. Can you even imagine? &#8220;Cool! 5 collaborators on private repositories. I guess I&#8217;ll sign up&#8230; <strong>Oh? You&#8217;re going to give me your unlimited, $100/month plan for free because I&#8217;m a student?</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not an advertisement to get referrals so I can get 1 extra collaborator for my free BitBucket account. Do you know why? Because <strong>BitBucket has given me an unlimited collaborator, unlimited private repository, regularly $100/month plan for free because I`m a university student. There is literally nothing left for me to gain.</strong></p>
<p>Go sign up. Not because I want you to, but because you know you want to.</p>
