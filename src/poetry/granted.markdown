I wore almost all black where I was,   
and all the restaurant was here is setting:   
good beer, no food, and friends' beauty;   
"thick leather" couches, books, and shit weather&mdash;   
*late refuge*&mdash;

I needed black socks, but I had a black pen   
for when we took the coloring book there for drunks.   
"Draw a friend in the empty space," it read,   
but "instead" I put "He's already there!,"   
and he was&mdash;  

until, in his place,  
I saw that Grant, a new friend,  
had begun sketching something:  
a pint of an ale or a stout or piss or something,  
or&mdash;something&mdash;

&mdash;

Granted, it was well drawn,  
for a sketch in a book for sketches by drunks,  
but to be honest, honestly,  
I wish he'd not drawn in the coloring book  
where I said my friend was, at least.
