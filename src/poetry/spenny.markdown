I could say you're real  
and that I'm proud of who you are  

<p class="long indent">But then I feel like we both descend into this meta level of things</p>
<p>
because what does that mean?<br>
"I'll just laugh or say thanks,"<br>
And, it's like,<br>
I would have to meet you there as well<br>
to make the words themselves really count,</p>
<p class="long noindent">but meeting you there would require meeting you at the next level too</p>
<p>because it never stops</p>
<p class="long">and we're always isolated from each other in that sense</p>

<p class="indent">
But then it all comes back</p>
<p class="long noindent">because I like you because I feel like you already understand this</p>
<p>so that I don't have to say anything at all</p>
